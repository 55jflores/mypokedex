# mypokedex
React native Pokedex app

Used Expo to help me create a bare react native app quickly to get started

Used no external packages

Initial page shows you the Pokemons that you can traverse through

You can go forward or backwards, and like or dislike the pokemon you are viewing

The favorites section shows the pokemon that you liked

You can toggle between viewing all the pokemons or only the ones you liked by clicking the button on the top right

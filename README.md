# mypokedex
React native Pokedex app

Used Expo to help me create a bare react native app quickly to get started: expo init projectName
- runs using expo start command
- executed on phone by using the camera QR scanner with the expo application installed on the phone

Used no external packages

Initial page shows you the Pokemons that you can traverse through

You can go forward or backwards, and like or dislike the pokemon you are viewing

The favorites section shows the pokemon that you liked. Scroll left and right to view your favorite pokemon

You can toggle between viewing all the pokemons or only the ones you liked by clicking the button on the top right
